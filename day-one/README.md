# Day One Projects

These projects weren't all built in a day, but they are the projects I consider to be the absolute most basic. These are projects that primarily test your ability to recall syntax, and were
inspired by some advice I had gotten when coming back to coding again and again without success: When learning how to code, get the syntax down until you can remember it in your sleep. When
you do, it makes it far easier to build the skeleton of more difficult projects in your head, because you're already intimately familiar with how the language works on the most basic level.
All of the fancy formatting and neat tricks will come afterwards.
